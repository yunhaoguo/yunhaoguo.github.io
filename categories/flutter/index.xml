      <description>Introduction Most apps contain several screens for displaying different types of information. For example, an app might have a screen that displays products. Users can then tap the image of a product to get more detailed information on a new screen.
Terminology: In Flutter, screens and pages are called routes.
In Android, a route is equivalent to an Activity. In iOS, a route is equivalent to a ViewController. In Flutter, a route is just a widget.</description>
